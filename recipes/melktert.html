        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is is one of the most, traditional desserts in South Africa. The actual meaning of the dish is a milk tart. The mean structure of the dessert is made with lots of milk,
            flour, and eggs, which gives it a smooth creamy texture that melts in your mouth. To celebrate the dish there is also National Milk Tart Day. So you love milk and tart order 
            this without even looking at the menu. This will be served with a touch of cinnamon on the top to compliment a flavor.

        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <h4>Shortcrust Pastry base</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>For the pastry, pulse the butter, flour and sugar in a food processor until it has the consistency of breadcrumbs. Alternately, rub in the cold butter with two knives or a pastry cutter. Try not to use your hands as it will warm up the butter.</li>
            <li>Add the egg and water and mix until just combined.</li>
            <li>Bring the pastry into a ball and flatten into a disk on a piece of cling wrap. This makes it easier to roll into a round shape later.</li>
            <li>Chill and rest the pastry for about 30 minutes before use.</li>
            <li>Roll out the pastry and line a 25 cm tart pan ensuring that the pastry overlaps the sides a bit as it may shrink during baking if not rested enough. I chilled it again for another 10 minutes before baking.</li>
            <li>Switch on the oven and heat to 200 degrees celcius / 400 F / Gas mark 6.</li>
            <li>Prick the base and line with parchment paper and baking beans or beans, and bake blind for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the baking beans and bake for another five minutes. Be careful not to get a burn as you may drop the beans and damage the tart case.</li>
            <li>Reduce the oven temperature to 170 degrees celcius / 350 F / Gas mark 4.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Milk Tart filling</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Cook the filling while the pastry base is baking in the oven.</li>
            <li>In a medium size bowl mix the butter and flour ensuring there are no lumps. Add in the condensed milk, vanilla and the egg yolks and mix until smooth.</li>
            <li>Heat the milk until it reaches boiling point stirring occasionally with a flat edged wooden spoon to prevent it catching and burning on the bottom of the pot. </li>
            <li>Add a little of the boiled milk to the egg mixture ensuring that you whisk out all the lumps. Slowly add the rest of the milk while whisking or stirring and then return to the pot and place back on the heat.</li>
            <li>Stir the milk mixture on the heat until it thickens and it starts to bubble.</li>
            <li>Remove the pot from the stove and let the mixture cool for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Whisk the egg whites and salt until they are glossy but not too stiff. It should be soft peaks at this stage, not the 'tip it over your head and it doesn't drop' stiffness.</li>
            <li>Fold the egg whites into the cooled custard mixture.</li>
            <li>Pour into the pastry case and bake for 15-20 minutes until it is set. Do not over bake as it will rise and sink like an overdone souffle.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with cinnamon powder and serve.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>I use cake flour or fine sponge flour for the pastry as well as the filling. If you are using any other type of flour the consistency may differ.
            1 cup of All purpose flour is supposed to be equivalent to 1 1/4 cups of cake flour.

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is is one of the most, traditional desserts in South Africa. The actual meaning of the dish is a milk tart. The mean structure of the dessert is made with lots of milk,
            flour, and eggs, which gives it a smooth creamy texture that melts in your mouth. To celebrate the dish there is also National Milk Tart Day. So you love milk and tart order 
            this without even looking at the menu. This will be served with a touch of cinnamon on the top to compliment a flavor.

        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <h4>Shortcrust Pastry base</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>For the pastry, pulse the butter, flour and sugar in a food processor until it has the consistency of breadcrumbs. Alternately, rub in the cold butter with two knives or a pastry cutter. Try not to use your hands as it will warm up the butter.</li>
            <li>Add the egg and water and mix until just combined.</li>
            <li>Bring the pastry into a ball and flatten into a disk on a piece of cling wrap. This makes it easier to roll into a round shape later.</li>
            <li>Chill and rest the pastry for about 30 minutes before use.</li>
            <li>Roll out the pastry and line a 25 cm tart pan ensuring that the pastry overlaps the sides a bit as it may shrink during baking if not rested enough. I chilled it again for another 10 minutes before baking.</li>
            <li>Switch on the oven and heat to 200 degrees celcius / 400 F / Gas mark 6.</li>
            <li>Prick the base and line with parchment paper and baking beans or beans, and bake blind for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the baking beans and bake for another five minutes. Be careful not to get a burn as you may drop the beans and damage the tart case.</li>
            <li>Reduce the oven temperature to 170 degrees celcius / 350 F / Gas mark 4.</li>
 
        </ol>

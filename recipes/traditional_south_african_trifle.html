        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>South Africans love dessert after big feasts as much as everybody else and it is the season of no-guilt eating. There’s one dessert that has many variations and arguments about what the right version is and it’s trifle. It’s a tall layered dessert which has biscuits, jelly and custard in each layer. Our South African trifle recipe has all of the landmarks of this iconic dessert with an Amarula cream liqueur twist.</p>
        <h3>Additional info</h3>
        <p>You want a deep bowl for this tall dessert as each layer is stacked high. The Amarula creaminess is great with the ladyfinger or cat’s tongue biscuits but you can also soak them in brandy or sherry. You can of course make your own homemade custard, however, sometimes it’s easier to use the store-bought version which everybody enjoys and it’s a bit thicker and will hold its shape. The fruit and jelly flavour choices are also up to you and you can stack your trifle as high as you want to.</p>
